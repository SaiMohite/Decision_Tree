# Steps :
1.Convert the data into a Pandas DataFrame for better visualization and manipulation.

2.Split the data into features (x) and target (y).

3.Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (70%-30%) using train_test_split.

4.Train a Decision Tree Classifier using the Gini impurity criterion with a maximum tree depth of 3 for better interpretability.

5.Fit the model on the training data.

6.Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy and classification report.

7.Visualize the decision tree using sklearn.tree.plot_tree.

8.Export the decision rules in a human-readable format using export_text.

# Tools and Libraries:
1.Python: Programming language used for implementation.

2.Scikit-learn: For dataset loading, model training, and visualization.

3.Matplotlib: For visualizing the decision tree.

4.Pandas: For dataset manipulation.
5.Jupyter Notebook: For code execution and visualization.
